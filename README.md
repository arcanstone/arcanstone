##### I try to avoid using tech which isn't ethical. Unfortunately you may find some of these in my past projects that are stored elsewhere. Unethical tech includes:
- ##### Amazon (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch, SageMaker)
- ##### Google (Compute Engine, App Engine, Firebase, BigQuery, Vertex AI)
- ##### Microsoft (Azure VMs, Cosmos DB, Azure ML, Logic Apps, Azure DevOps)

#### current interest:
- ##### Building tools to help accelerate marking in introductory math and proofs classes
