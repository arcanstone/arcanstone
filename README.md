> *Building scalable systems, advancing programming language theory, and solving complex computational problems*

## About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Toronto with a strong foundation in **distributed systems**, **deep learning**, and **programming language design**. As a Software Engineering Research Assistant, I'm advancing the frontiers of **dependently-typed functional programming** and **formal verification**.

**Current Focus:** Developing next-generation programming languages for mathematical proof construction and high-performance distributed systems.

## Research & Innovation

### Dependently-Typed Programming Language Research
- **Extending Pie Language**: Building advanced features for formal proof construction
- **Type Theory**: Implementing bidirectional type-checkers and normalization engines
- **Automated Verification**: Enabling mathematical proof verification through code synthesis

## Featured Projects
