## About Me

I'm a  Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Toronto with a strong foundation in distributed systems**, **deep learning**, and **programming language design**. As a Software Engineering Research Assistant, I worked with **dependently-typed functional programming** and **formal verification**.

**Current Focus:** Developing programming languages for mathematical proof construction and working with high-performance distributed systems.

### Research
- **Extending Pie Language**: Building advanced features for formal proof construction
- **Type Theory**: Implementing bidirectional type-checkers and normalization engines
- **Automated Verification**: Enabling mathematical proof verification through code synthesis

## Let's Connect

I'm interested in discussing:
- **Distributed Systems Architecture**
- **Programming Language Theory**
- **Research Collaborations**
