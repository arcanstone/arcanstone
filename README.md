> *Building scalable systems, advancing programming language theory, and solving complex computational problems*

## About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Toronto with a strong foundation in **distributed systems**, **deep learning**, and **programming language design**. As a Software Engineering Research Assistant, I worked with **dependently-typed functional programming** and **formal verification**.

**Current Focus:** Developing programming languages for mathematical proof construction and high-performance distributed systems.

## Research

### Dependently-Typed Programming Language Research
- **Extending Pie Language**: Building advanced features for formal proof construction
- **Type Theory**: Implementing bidirectional type-checkers and normalization engines
- **Automated Verification**: Enabling mathematical proof verification through code synthesis

## Featured Projects

### [Distributed URL Shortener](https://github.com/arcanstone/DistributedURLShortener)
**High-Performance Distributed Systems in Java**
- Can handle **50,000+ req/sec** throughput with **2.3ms average latency**
- Consistent hashing, automatic failover, and horizontal scalability
- Custom load-balancing proxy with LRU caching (**40% latency reduction**)
- Supports **10,000+ concurrent users** with 98% uptime

### [Deep Learning Super Sampling](https://github.com/HarshitGupta29/DeepLearningSuperSampling)
**SRGAN + Neural Radiance Fields Integration**
- **4x image super-resolution** with perceptually realistic results
- Novel coarse-to-fine neural architecture for content-aware processing
- Outperforms traditional interpolation methods in preserving fine details
- Applications in gaming, drone imaging, and medical microscopy
